Explainable Classifier Supporting Decision-making for Breast Cancer Diagnosis from Histopathological Images
//Something similar we should aim at writing.
https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852070

Integrating Machine Learning with Symbolic Reasoning to Build an Explainable AI Model for Stroke Prediction
//Good paper we should aim at replicating.
https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2019.00152

Towards Explainable Melanoma Diagnosis: Prediction of Clinical Indicators Using Semi-supervised and Multi-task Learning
//Checklist based approach at XAI.
https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005726

Explainable Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis
//A pretty straight forward and clean paper.
https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1109/BRACIS.2019.00124

Interpretability in HealthCare: A Comparative Study of Local Machine Learning Interpretability Techniques
//A comparision between explainable models on medical data.
https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1109/CBMS.2019.00065

Explainable Sentiment Analysis with Applications in Medicine
//WTF is this? No results or research but got published in an IEEE conference!
https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621359

A Framework for Explainable Text Classification in Legal Document Review
//Their methods used not stated clearly. Needs to be scrutinised further.
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09501.pdf

A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Explainable Recommendation
//Seems promising but needs understanding of reinforcement learning. Paper is similar to our goal.
https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2018.00074





//Just some survey papers below for reference

Peeking Inside the Black-Box: A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
//Good overall picture. Note the areas of use for XAI mentioned.
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8466590

A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): towards Medical XAI
//Not much informative. Does not provide any guidance to base our paper on. But it 'is' a survey.
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07374.pdf
